        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In school, many students read classic literature by authors like Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. However, understanding 
            the traditional, formal English can be challenging, making it hard for modern readers to fully appreciate these texts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project aims to create a system that converts Shakespearean English into modern English sentences. This will help 
            people understand these classic texts more easily while preserving their original meaning and tone. Using Natural Language 
            Processing (NLP) techniques focused on style transfer, we plan to employ both pre-trained models and train our own models 
            to build a small hybrid system for converting these texts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by our own experiences as students struggling to understand complex texts, this project demonstrates how AI and NLP 
            can help make difficult, old language easier to comprehend. In essence, this tool will allow users to input sentences in 
            Shakespearean English and receive modern English translations, leveraging the power of NLP for meaningful language transformation.
